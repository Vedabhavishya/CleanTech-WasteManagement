## üìå Problem Statement

Traditional waste sorting methods are manual, time-consuming, and error-prone. CleanTech automates this process by:
- Classifying waste through images.
- Enabling real-time sorting in smart bins and industrial use cases.
- Reducing human effort and improving recycling efficiency.
